WARNING
===============================================================================

These files are for demo purposes only. They will not work as run, but are
here to show you what they would look in a full project folder. I don't want to
upload a huge rails app just to have a single example, and I haven't played
around with cucumber in any other language yet. Copying the feature folder 
into an existing rails app should work if you have the right gems (see README).
